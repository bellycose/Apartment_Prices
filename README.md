### Program Process
1. Collect objects/data from HTML5 with Requests.
2. Parse data (eg. date, winning-numbers, number) with Beautiful Soup.
3. Draw informations with Pandas and Matplotlib.
4. Convey information about the population through statistics tests.
5. Write a conclusion and document report.

### Data
Data are retrieved from website by web scraping in real time by python. Then converted from data frame into csv and stored in 'database' folder. And summary are saved in the xlsx file named 'TABLENOVA'.
### Visuals
